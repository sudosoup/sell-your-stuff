# sell-your-stuff
An application to help you manage Craigslist, FB Marketplace, etc postings to sell stuff you don't want anymore.

The web app lets you build a simple inventory of items you want to sell. Items are stored locally in your browser so they stay between visits without requiring any accounts or server setup.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This runs a small Express server with a SQLite database. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to add and view items.
